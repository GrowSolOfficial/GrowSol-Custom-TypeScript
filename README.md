GrowSol, as a milestone, is set to release here on GitHub, its own custom Python script needed to automate the process of reward distribution, for free. 
This move aims to promote equal opportunities and stimulate growth in the Solana ecosystem. 
By incentivizing developers to create reward tokens, GrowSol anticipates sparking new projects and ideas, thereby attracting more participants to the Solana network.
Now, you have the chance to deploy your own contract at no upfront cost, utilizing the capabilities of a Virtual Private Server (VPS) alongside Remote Procedure Call (RPC) functionality. 
With these tools, you can automate transactions effortlessly, managing rewards and distributing them to holders without incurring additional expenses. 
This streamlined process enhances accessibility, enabling users to assert FULL control over their contracts and transactions, ushering in an era of autonomy and efficiency in the cryptocurrency realm.

--------------------------------


This TypeScript script is designed to run on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to automate the process of rewarding token holders and distributing those rewards accordingly.

Note: Files and the tutorial will be shared here on GitHub.
